# Inventory Manager


I'm so proud of myself to finish my FIRST fullstack project. 
Into this fantasy company website called "Inventory Manager" we can create an account whose will be send to the postgreSQL through Java settings with SpringBoot, as well as insert and manage products with CRUD operations.

The frontend was developed with ReactJS, using libs like react icons, input masks, styled components and router dom.

All those pages are styled and responsive to some displays.
